# test-sentiment_analysis
*a simple test for sentiment analysis using gensim, pytorch, numpy...*

I used [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/vdemario/teste-de-c-digo-nlp/notebook), it's is very small for good results but is interesting about overfitting

This experiment is composed in 3 notebooks:

* Convolutional Neural Network 2D :ok:
* Convolutional Neural Netword 1D :ok:
* Recurrent Neural Network with GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) :hammer_and_pick:
